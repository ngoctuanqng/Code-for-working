Self-Invoking Functions--Các kiến thức nền tảng JAVASCRIPT:
									Function expressions can be made "self-invoking".
									A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.
									Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ().
									You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.
									You have to add parentheses around the function to indicate that it is a function expression:
									
									<!DOCTYPE html>
									<html>
									<body>
									<p>Functions can be invoked automatically without being called:</p>
									<p id="demo"></p> // Hello! I called myself
									<script>
									(function () {
									  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello! I called myself";
									})(); // 
									</script>
									</body>
									</html>
