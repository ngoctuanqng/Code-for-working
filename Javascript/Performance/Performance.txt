Performance--Các kiến thức nền tảng JAVASCRIPT:

	Reduce Activity in Loops:
		Bad:
									for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {}
		Better Code:
									let l = arr.length;
									for (let i = 0; i < l; i++) {}
									
	Reduce DOM Access:
									Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements. If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable:
									
									<!DOCTYPE html>
									<html>
									<body>
									<h2>JavaScript Performance</h2>
									<p>If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and the use it as a local variable:</p>
									<p id="demo"></p>
									<script>
									const obj = document.getElementById("demo");
									obj.innerHTML = " Hello";
									</script>
									</body>
									</html> 
	
	Reduce DOM Size:
	
									Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small. This will always improve page loading, and speed up rendering (page display), especially on smaller devices.
									Every attempt to search the DOM (like getElementsByTagName) will benefit from a smaller DOM.
									
	Avoid Unnecessary Variables:
	
									Don't create new variables if you don't plan to save values.
									
		Often you can replace code like this:							
									
									let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
									document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fullName;
									
		With this:
		
									document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = firstName + " " + lastName;
									
		Delay JavaScript Loading:

									Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body lets the browser load the page first.
									While a script is downloading, the browser will not start any other downloads. In addition all parsing and rendering activity might be blocked.
									If possible, you can add your script to the page by code, after the page has loaded:
									
									<script>
									window.onload = function() {
									  const element = document.createElement("script");
									  element.src = "myScript.js";
									  document.body.appendChild(element);
									};
									</script>
