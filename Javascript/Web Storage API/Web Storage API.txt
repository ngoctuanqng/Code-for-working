Web Storage API--JAVASCRIPT:

	The Web Storage API is a simple syntax for storing and retrieving data in the browser. It is very easy to use:
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		<body>
		<p id="demo"></p>
		<script>
		localStorage.setItem("name","John Doe");
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = localStorage.getItem("name");
		</script>
		</body>
		</html>
		
	The localStorage Object
		
		The localStorage object provides access to a local storage for a particular Web Site. It allows you to store, read, add, modify, and delete data items for that domain.

		The data is stored with no expiration date, and will not be deleted when the browser is closed.

		The data will be available for days, weeks, and years.
		
	The setItem() Method
		
		The localStorage.setItem() method stores a data item in a storage.

		It takes a name and a value as parameters:
				
				localStorage.setItem("name", "John Doe");
		
	The getItem() Method
			
		The localStorage.getItem() method retrieves a data item from the storage.

		It takes a name as parameter:
				
				localStorage.getItem("name");
		
	The sessionStorage Object
			
		The sessionStorage object is identical to the localStorage object.

		The difference is that the sessionStorage object stores data for one session.

		The data is deleted when the browser is closed.
		
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		<body>
		<p id="demo"></p>
		<script>
		sessionStorage.setItem("name","John Doe");
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = sessionStorage.getItem("name");
		</script>
		</body>
		</html>
