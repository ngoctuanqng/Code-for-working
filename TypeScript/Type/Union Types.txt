Union Types--TypeScript:

	Union types are used when a value can be more than a single type.

	Such as when a property would be string or number.
	
	Union | (OR)--Union Types Typescript:
	
		Using the | we are saying our parameter is a string or number:
			
			function printStatusCode(code: string | number) {
			  console.log(`My status code is ${code}.`)
			}
			printStatusCode(404);
			printStatusCode('404');
	
	Union Type Errors--Union Types Typescript:
	
		Note: you need to know what your type is when union types are being used to avoid type errors:
			
			function printStatusCode(code: string | number) {
			  console.log(`My status code is ${code.toUpperCase()}.`) // error: Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'. Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'
			}
		
		In our example we are having an issue invoking toUpperCase() as its a string method and number doesn't have access to it.
