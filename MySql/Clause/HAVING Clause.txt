HAVING Clause--MySQL:
											The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
	Syntax
											SELECT column_name(s)
											FROM table_name
											WHERE condition
											GROUP BY column_name(s)
											HAVING condition
											ORDER BY column_name(s);
	Example:
											SELECT 
												product_id,
												product_name,
												SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales
											FROM 
												sales
											GROUP BY 
												product_id, product_name
											HAVING 
												total_sales > 1000;
