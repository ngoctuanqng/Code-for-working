Working With Dates--MySQL:
											The most difficult part when working with dates is to be sure that the format of the date
											you are trying to insert, matches the format of the date column in the database.
											
											As long as your data contains only the date portion, your queries will work as
											expected. However, if a time portion is involved, it gets more complicated.
	DATE - Format YYYY-MM-DD:										
												SELECT *
												FROM Orders
												WHERE OrderDate = '2008-11-11';
	DATETIME - Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS:												
												SELECT *
												FROM Orders
												WHERE OrderDateTime = '2008-11-11 12:30:45';
	TIMESTAMP - Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS:											
												SELECT *
												FROM Orders
												WHERE OrderTimestamp = '2008-11-11 12:30:45';
	YEAR - Format YYYY or YY:											
												SELECT *
												FROM Orders
												WHERE YEAR(OrderYear) = 2008;
