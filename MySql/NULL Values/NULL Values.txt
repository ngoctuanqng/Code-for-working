NULL Values--MySQL:
							A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.
							
							If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding
							a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.
							
							It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
							
							We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.
	IS NULL:
				Syntax:
							SELECT column_names
							FROM table_name
							WHERE column_name IS NULL;
				Example:
							SELECT * 
							FROM employees
							WHERE last_name IS NULL; // kiểm tra xem giá trị trong cột "last_name" có là NULL không
	IS NOT NULL:
				Syntax:
							SELECT column_names
							FROM table_name
							WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
				Example:
							SELECT * 
							FROM employees
							WHERE last_name IS NOT NULL; // kiểm tra xem giá trị trong cột "last_name" có khác NULL không
