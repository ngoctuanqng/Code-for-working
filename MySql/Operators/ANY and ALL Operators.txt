ANY and ALL Operators--MySQL:
											The ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values.
	ANY:
		Syntax:								
											SELECT column_name(s)
											FROM table_name
											WHERE column_name operator ANY
											  (SELECT column_name
											  FROM table_name
											  WHERE condition);
		Example:									
											SELECT 
												product_id,
												product_name,
												selling_price
											FROM 
												products
											WHERE 
												selling_price >= ANY (SELECT selling_price FROM products WHERE product_id <> 1);
	ALL:
		Syntax:
											SELECT ALL column_name(s)
											FROM table_name
											WHERE condition;
		
											SELECT column_name(s)
											FROM table_name
											WHERE column_name operator ALL
											  (SELECT column_name
											  FROM table_name
											  WHERE condition);

		Example:
											SELECT 
												product_id,
												product_name,
												selling_price
											FROM 
												products
											WHERE 
												selling_price > ALL (SELECT selling_price FROM products WHERE product_id <> 1);
