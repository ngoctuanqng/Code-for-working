Views--MySQL:
									In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
									A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
									You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.
	CREATE VIEW:	
						Syntax:	
									CREATE VIEW view_name AS
									SELECT column1, column2, ...
									FROM table_name
									WHERE condition;
						Example:	
									CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
									SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
									FROM Customers
									WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
									
									SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];
									
									CREATE VIEW [Products Above Average Price] AS
									SELECT ProductName, Price
									FROM Products
									WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);
	Updating a View:	
						Syntax:	
									CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
									SELECT column1, column2, ...
									FROM table_name
									WHERE condition;
						Example:	
									CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
									SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City
									FROM Customers
									WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
	Dropping a View:	
						Syntax:		DROP VIEW view_name;
						Example:	DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers];
