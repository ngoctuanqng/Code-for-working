ORDER BY Keyword--MySQL:
				The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
				The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
	Syntax:
				SELECT column1, column2, ...
				FROM table_name
				ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
	Example:
				SELECT student_id, first_name, last_name, age
				FROM students
				ORDER BY age ASC, last_name DESC;
