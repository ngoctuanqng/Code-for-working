Packages--JAVA:
													A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable
													code.
	Built-in Packages:
													The library is divided into packages and classes. Meaning you can either import a single class (along with its methods and attributes), or a whole package that contain all
													the classes that belong to the specified package.
													
													import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
													import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package
													
													import java.util.Scanner; // import the Scanner class 
													class Main {
													  public static void main(String[] args) {
														Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);
														String userName;														
														// Enter username and press Enter
														System.out.println("Enter username"); 
														userName = myObj.nextLine();   														   
														System.out.println("Username is: " + userName);        
													  }
													}
													
													import java.util.*; // import the java.util package 
													class Main {
													  public static void main(String[] args) {
														Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);
														String userName;														
														// Enter username and press Enter
														System.out.println("Enter username"); 
														userName = myObj.nextLine();   											   
														System.out.println("Username is: " + userName);        
													  }
													}
	User-defined Packages:
													To create your own package, you need to understand that Java uses a file system directory to store them. Just like folders on your computer.
													
													To create a package, use the package keyword:
													
													package mypack;
													class MyPackageClass { 
													  public static void main(String[] args) { 
														System.out.println("This is my package!"); 
													  } 
													}
													
													Save the file as MyPackageClass.java, and compile it:
													C:\Users\Your Name>javac MyPackageClass.java
													
													Then compile the package:
													C:\Users\Your Name>javac -d . MyPackageClass.java // The -d keyword specifies the destination for where to save the class file. You can use any directory name, like
																									  // c:/user (windows), or, if you want to keep the package within the same directory, you can use the dot sign "."
																									  // When we compiled the package in the example above, a new folder was created, called "mypack".
																									  
													To run the MyPackageClass.java file, write the following:
													C:\Users\Your Name>java mypack.MyPackageClass
													
													The output will be:
													This is my package!
